  abstract = {The human genome contains more than 200,000 gene isoforms. However, different isoforms can be highly similar, and with an average length of 1.5kb remain difficult to study with short read sequencing. To systematically evaluate the ability to study the transcriptome at a resolution of individual isoforms we profiled 5 human cell lines with short read cDNA sequencing and Nanopore long read direct RNA, amplification-free direct cDNA, PCR-cDNA sequencing. The long read protocols showed a high level of consistency, with amplification-free RNA and cDNA sequencing being most similar. While short and long reads generated comparable gene expression estimates, they differed substantially for individual isoforms. We find that increased read length improves read-to-transcript assignment, identifies interactions between alternative promoters and splicing, enables the discovery of novel transcripts from repetitive regions, facilitates the quantification of full-length fusion isoforms and enables the simultaneous profiling of m6A RNA modifications when RNA is sequenced directly. Our study demonstrates the advantage of long read RNA sequencing and provides a comprehensive resource that will enable the development and benchmarking of computational methods for profiling complex transcriptional events at isoform-level resolution.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Motivation               In RNA-seq differential expression analysis, investigators aim to detect those genes with changes in expression level across conditions, despite technical and biological variability in the observations. A common task is to accurately estimate the effect size, often in terms of a logarithmic fold change (LFC).                                         Results               When the read counts are low or highly variable, the maximum likelihood estimates for the LFCs has high variance, leading to large estimates not representative of true differences, and poor ranking of genes by effect size. One approach is to introduce filtering thresholds and pseudocounts to exclude or moderate estimated LFCs. Filtering may result in a loss of genes from the analysis with true differences in expression, while pseudocounts provide a limited solution that must be adapted per dataset. Here, we propose the use of a heavy-tailed Cauchy prior distribution for effect sizes, which avoids the use of filter thresholds or pseudocounts. The proposed method, Approximate Posterior Estimation for generalized linear model, apeglm, has lower bias than previously proposed shrinkage estimators, while still reducing variance for those genes with little information for statistical inference.                                         Availability and implementation               The apeglm package is available as an R/Bioconductor package at https://bioconductor.org/packages/apeglm, and the methods can be called from within the DESeq2 software.                                         Supplementary information               Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},
