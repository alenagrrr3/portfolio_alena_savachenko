# Creating R packages


   <h3> Creating R packages  </h3>
   <h4> Create your own package and publish it on Github  </h4>


<div class="azure"> 
To complete this portfolio assingment you need to perform the following steps:

    From your collection of RMarkdown files, collect 1 or a few that you know contain duplication of code (which should be fixed by writing a function). If there are already functions in your RMarkdown files, you can also select those
    Setup a new RStudio project with an R package (think about a cool name* - cannot included special character and spaces), linked to a github repo in your Github account
    Transfer the RMarkdown files that you selected in step 1 (and all their dependencies like data and scripts) to your new package (put them in the appropriate folders).
    Using what you have learnt so far (and what you can read from https://r-pkgs.org/index.html and https://emilyriederer.netlify.app/post/rmarkdown-driven-development/), transform your RMarkdown files into one R package. Publish the link to this package in your portfolio:

*When choosing a name for a package, this quote from might help:

“Side-note, if you are to create an R package, you need a name. It needs to be unique, especially if you plan on getting your package on CRAN. The {available} package can help you evaluate possible names to make sure they do not clash with other names and that they do not mean something rude.”

We do not appreciate package names including offensive words

Use this code to check the name you would like to use:

library(available)
available("your_intended_package_name")

To pass this assignment, your new package should at least include:

    A properly formatted DESCRIPTION file, with all the fields including relevant information (so change the default values)
    4 different functions that you wrote and with proper documentation, using roxygen2 comments
    A NAMESPACE file, generated with the command devtools::document()
    1 Raw dataset that is documented and cleaned into a clean dataset. This clean dataset should be accessible inside your package. This means that if I install your package from Github, I would be able to call data(<dataset_name>, <package_name>) to load the cleaned dataset of interest in the Global Environment.
    One vignette that is accessible via the command browseVignettes(<package_name>) or vignette(<package_name>)
    The package installs from Github without errors when I run: devtools::install_github("account_name/package_name")
